Simply a script archive for schoolwork I've done in R.
No particular, clean organization or purpose but just a raw collection of the methods I've used to serve as a reminder
  for if these methods are needed later on.
  
Classes for which these scripts have been used are:
1) Advance Quantative Methods (for Econometrics) in R
2) Causal Inference (in Research & Statistics)
3) Bayesian/Classical Inference
